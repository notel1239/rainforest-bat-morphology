# Data Dictionary: Species Codes

This file provides a lookup table for the `species_id` codes used in `bat_morphology_raw.csv`. Each code corresponds to a bat species (or morphospecies) captured during the field study.

| species_id | Full Scientific Name | Common Name | Ecological Notes |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| PTP1       | *Pteropus temminckii* | Temminck's Fruit Bat | Large frugivore, typically forages in the upper canopy. |
| MGL2       | *Myotis gilvus*      | Small Pale Myotis | Insectivorous, often captures prey in open gaps and near water bodies. |
| RHP3       | *Rhinolophus philippinensis* | Philippine Horseshoe Bat | Insectivorous, uses echolocation with distinctive nose-leaf morphology. Often roosts in caves. |
| EPH4       | *Epomophorus gambianus* | Gambian Epauletted Fruit Bat | Medium-sized frugivore, known for its epaulettes (shoulder patches). |
| MSP5       | *Mystacina sp.*      | Short-tailed Bat | Unique among bats for spending considerable time on the ground; insectivorous/frugivorous. |

## Notes on Identification

- Species were identified by experienced field biologists using morphological keys and, where possible, genetic barcoding.
- The codes are arbitrary but consistent across the dataset. If you require taxonomic updates or additional details, please open an issue in the repository.
